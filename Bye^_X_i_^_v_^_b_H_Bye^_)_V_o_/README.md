# Nameless Program #2

## Program Contents
```yaml
Bye^_X_i_^_v_^_b_H_Bye^_)_V_o_
```

## What does it do?

This unnamed program will simply try to delete itself while it runs (but, joke's on me, Windows prevents this !)

> **Note:**
> Hmm, I haven't tried, but it's probably possible to delete important files with this if modified, so...

## How does it work

- Lists every file whose path contains `Bye` in the current directory
- Deletes them. (or at least it tries to)

## Usage

Use as-is. You can change which file to delete by replacing both `Bye` instances by your own file identifier in the program.
