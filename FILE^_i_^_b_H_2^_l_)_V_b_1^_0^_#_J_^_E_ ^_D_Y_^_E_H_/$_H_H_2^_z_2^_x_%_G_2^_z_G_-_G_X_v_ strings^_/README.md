# Nameless Program #4

> **Warning**: The `|` character in the folder name to this file was replaced with a `l` due to windows not allowing it. It should, however, indeed be a `|` character

## Program Contents
```yaml
aU_fileU_toU_testU_thisU_programi_txt^_i_^_b_H_2^_|_)_V_b_1^_0^_#_J_^_E_ ^_D_Y_^_E_H_\$_H_H_2^_z_2^_x_%_G_2^_z_G_-_G_X_v_ strings^_
```

## What does it do?

This unnamed program will count the number of double quoted strings in a file. An example file is provided : [a_file_to_test_this_program.txt](a_file_to_test_this_program.txt).

> **Note:**
> Hmm, I haven't tried, but it's probably possible to delete important files with this if modified, so...

## Usage

To try your own file, either replace the content of the provided file, or change the path at the beginning of the program (starting from `aU_fileU_`... until `_txt`).
> **Reminder:**
> `U_` indicates a `_` character at this spot in the target file name.
> `i_` indicates a `.` character at this spot in the target file name.
