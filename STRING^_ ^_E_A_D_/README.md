# Nameless Program #1

## Program Contents
```yaml
STRING^_ ^_E_A_D_
```

## What does it do?

This unnamed program is my first ever written with the amazing namingless programming language. 

It can be used to remove spaces in a string ! How useful ^w^

## Usage

Replace STRING at the beginning of the program with your own payload. 

For example, to remove spaces in `This string has spaces, how inconvenient...`, run as:


```yaml
STRING^_ ^_E_A_D_
```
