# Namingless Programs


## About this repo

These programs have no names. They are meant to be ran with a [namingless programming language](https://github.com/akalenuk/the_namingless_programming_language).

Each directory contains a README.md with the program inside. It is unintelligible, so you probably won't know what each program does until you open the appropriate folder and read the README.

Was this painful task useful? Well, basically as much as the program contributed to making the world a better place. I'll let you think on that ^w^. But at least, **I never had to name anything doing it, so that's a win** !!!

## Usage

To try out a program yourself, copy it from a README (or the directory name directly, that'll work as well), and paste it in your own local namingless programming language installation !
